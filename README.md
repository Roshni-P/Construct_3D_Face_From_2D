# Construct_3D_Face_From_2D
This project shows how to select a 2D image and construct a 3D face using OpenCV and EOS.
The user can select the image file that they intend to use. The application currently identifies facial landmarks using haarcascade. These are shown as bright red dots on the image.

A sample 3D face mesh is seen as below:
