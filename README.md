# Construct 3D Face Mesh From a 2D image
This project shows how to select a 2D image and construct a 3D face mesh using OpenCV and EOS and OpenGL.
The user can select the image file that they intend to use. The application identifies facial landmarks using haarcascade. These are shown as bright red dots on the image.

The ouput object wave format file is read and converted to a 3D mesh comprising of tiny triangles.

Seen below, is a sample 3D face mesh, generated as output :
